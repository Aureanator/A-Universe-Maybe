Discipline (referee item 15): every experiment below was **written down before it was run**.
Predictions carry the date and mental state of their writing. Outcomes are appended verbatim
after the run, never edited into the predictions. If we are wrong, the wrongness stays visible.

## P1 — The μ quotient: rigid vs flexible internal-resolution counts (referee item 1)

**Setup.** Cone `v * ∂Δ³` over A₄. Fix boundary labels; declare interior-face flux classes.
Two equivalence relations on admissible interiors `x = (x_0..x_3)`:
- **rigid**: `(x, B) ~ (ν⁻¹x_i, B)` — apex only, boundary labels held pointwise (current code).
- **flex**: quotient additionally by diagonal conjugation `(x, B) -> (μ⁻¹xμ, μ⁻¹Bμ)` — the
  residual freedom when the boundary is fixed only by its gauge-invariant content.

**Predictions (written before running):**
1. The referee's "Klein-four flux drops from 6 to 2" will reproduce under a natural Klein-four
   declaration: rigid count **6**, flex count strictly smaller (**2 or 1**).
2. The full cone census ("patterns with |I|>1 drop from 102 to 45") will NOT reproduce exactly —
   we expect the same *direction* (flex < rigid on every nonabelian pattern) but different
   magnitudes, because our declaration semantics (seeded curvature classes over flat boundary)
   differ from whatever ensemble they used. If flex == rigid for some pattern with nontrivial
   flux, that pattern's interiors are all rigidity-protected and we say why.
3. Z₃ control: flex == rigid on every abelian pattern, by construction (conjugation is trivial).
   This confirms the referee's "the abelian control is blind" point exactly.

**Outcome (run 2025-01-xx, `examples/critique/p1_mu_quotient.py`, 357 s):**

| declaration (flat boundary) | raw | rigid \|I\| | full-gauge pooled |
|---|---|---|---|
| 3 interior faces V4 / rest flat | 36 | **6** | **1** |
| 5 interior faces V4 / rest flat | 72 | **12** | **2** |
| all 6 faces V4 | 72 | **12** | **2** |
| seeded declaration, all 1728 tree-gauge boundaries | — | **4 (all)** | **1 (sample 40/40)** |

- Prediction 1 **half-hit**: rigid = 6 reproduced exactly on the 3-face declaration; that family's pooled count is 1, not 2. The referee's exact "6→2" did not appear in one declaration,
  but their *mechanism* is fully confirmed: pooled full-gauge counts collapse far below rigid
  (12→2 exactly as quoted on the 5/6-face family).
- Prediction 2 **hit**: direction universal (full ≤ rigid everywhere sampled, 40/40 collapses of
  seeded patterns to a single orbit), magnitudes differ per declaration.
- Prediction 3 **hit**: Z₃ control blind by construction (singleton classes).
- Declarations with class-V4-everywhere and *fewer than 3* flux faces are empty: adjacent interior
  faces over a flat boundary cannot both hold order-2 curvature unless the x's differ appropriately;
  K4-coloring obstruction. Nice constraint, unanticipated.

**Verdict:** referee item 1 is CONFIRMED as a convention hazard and REBUTTED as a bug:
`resolutions.py` computes the rigid (apparatus-relative) count correctly; E030's \|I(core)\|=4 is
rigid by definition. The pooled full-gauge count answers a different question (how many gauge-
inequivalent worlds share one appearance — answer: generically one). Fix = state the convention at
every \|I\| quote + ship `pooled_resolution_orbits` for the alternative semantics.

## P2 — Spanning-tree root dependence of verdicts (referee item 2)

**Setup.** Kuhn ball n=2, A₄, random labels; region = whole ball so `appearance()` =
boundary face curvatures + probe-cycle classes from a spanning tree of the surface 1-skeleton.
Apply single-edge right-multiplications; record accept/reject verdict under different tree roots.

**Predictions:**
1. Verdict-flip rate across roots is **exactly 0**. Face curvature classes are actual triangle
   holonomies — no basis choice enters them — and any edge move that changes a boundary face
   class is caught identically in every basis.
2. If flips appear, they must come from moves that leave all face classes fixed but shuffle
   cycle charges; the flip rate then measures how much of the predicate's teeth come from the
   (basis-dependent) cycle part versus the (invariant) face part. The referee's 12.4% would be
   evidence for this second mechanism — we will report which it is.
3. Either way: `Appearance.signature()` embeds loop identity and is therefore NOT comparable
   across different bases or between differently-built regions. We predict cross-basis signature
   equality fails on most curved configurations even when the physical state agrees. The fix is a
   simultaneous-conjugacy canonical form of raw based-loop holonomies (complete invariant for
   based loops under vertex gauge).

## P3 — Gauge equivariance of the proposal dynamics (referee item 3)

**Setup.** Single tetrahedron gauge slice, triples `(A02, A03, A13)`; global conjugation `g`
maps a config to a gauge-equivalent one. For each arm, compute exact accept fractions over all
(free edge × generator) proposals for a config and its conjugate.

**Predictions:**
1. Current arm (`move_generators()` = {s, t, t⁻¹}, not closed under conjugation): equivariance
   FAILS on some configs; we expect discrepancies of order 2/18 (referee reported 4/18 vs 6/18).
2. Class-closed arm (propose uniformly over full conjugacy classes): accept fractions agree
   EXACTLY for every config and every global conjugate — the induced chain descends to orbits.
3. Word cost: with a class-closed generating set, `generator_distance` is invariant under
   conjugation of both endpoints; with the current set it is not (referee's 1 vs 3 example).

---

## P4 — Pachner 2→3 degeneracy claim (referee item 4)

**Predictions:**
1. At HEAD `apply_pachner_2_3` constructs three **4-vertex** tuples `(u,w,a),(u,w,b),(u,w,c)`;
   the claimed "3-vertex tuple" bug does not reproduce in this codebase (it likely came from a
   harness outside it). Round-trip 2→3→2 restores the complex exactly on Kuhn n=2 sites.
2. Boundary (vertices, edges, faces and their labels) is unchanged by the round trip; only the
   interior changes — including the created edge's label surviving as an internal degree of freedom.

---

## P5 — Spectral dimension of the mesh (referee item 9)

**Setup.** Diffusion (random walk) on tetra-adjacency and vertex-graph structures of Kuhn balls
n = 1..4; return probability P(n_steps); d_s(t) = −2·dlogP/dlogt estimated locally.

**Predictions:**
1. Long-time spectral dimension ≈ **3** (within ~[2.5, 3.5]) at n≥3 — consistent with the
   3D input; this is a *consistency check*, not an emergence claim, and will be labeled as such.
2. Short-time d_s deviates strongly (lattice effects); we record the full curve rather than one number.
3. Vertex-1-skeleton diffusion gives d_s ≈ 3 as well; if it doesn't, that is a real finding about
   the walk structure and gets its own diary entry.

---

## P6 — Density normalization artifact (referee item 13)

**Setup.** Kuhn ball n=2, Driver A run ~5000 events; shells around centre; compare raw per-cell
`rho(cell)` with per-vertex `rho/|cell|`; vacuum control = same driver, flat labels.

**Predictions:**
1. Raw per-cell counts show a **size artifact**: outer shells (more vertices) accumulate more
   total events at uniform activity, so raw rho rises with shell size even in featureless runs.
2. Per-vertex normalization flattens the vacuum profile; defect-core excess survives and remains
   positive — i.e. the qualitative gravity-like signal is not an artifact, but its magnitude in
   the old plots was basis-confounded and gets re-measured.

## P7 — Softened-predicate confinement pilot (referee item 5; queued as first real physics)

**Status:** NOT YET PRE-REGISTERED — will be written before that experiment runs, with an area-law
scaling prediction for boundary-residue production under penalty λ. Listed here so the queue is visible.
